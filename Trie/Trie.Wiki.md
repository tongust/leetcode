# Trie 
Trie is also called **radix tree** or **prefix tree**, is a kind of search tree -- an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. The root is associated with the empty string.

For the space-optimized presentation of prefix tree, it can be implemented by compact prefix tree.
